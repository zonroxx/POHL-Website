        <h1 class="fade-in">The Non-Profit Corporation</h1>
        <p class="fade-in stagger-1">
          POHL is a non-profit corporation formed in 2013. Its Board of Directors are Pamela Brown Blackburn, President and Secretary, Anthony M. Babauta, Vice President and Laurie Peterka, Treasurer. Though newly founded, POHL is not by any means new in the Pacific Region. Each of the members of the Board are uniquely experienced in the criminal issues facing the Pacific Region.
        </p>
        <p class="fade-in stagger-2">
          With over 25 years of experience, President Blackburn holds extensive experience in combatting the perpetration of, and aiding victims of, domestic violence, sexual assault, including victims of sex trafficking, labor abuse, immigration abuse, trafficking in persons, discrimination and criminal law. As the former Assistant Secretary of the Office of Insular Affairs, Vice President Babauta has vast knowledge of the criminal issues common throughout the Pacific Region and the U.S. governments' efforts to end such abuses and to assist local governments in their respective efforts.
        </p>
        <p class="fade-in stagger-3">
          Treasurer Peterka has dedicated her career to issues and concerns facing the Pacific Region which has allowed her to travel extensively in the region. Each maintains strong networks and contacts that serve POHL's ability to primarily assist victims of these crimes but also to make an impact and drive change through collaborative efforts within the local community as well as the Pacific Region.
        </p>

        <h2 class="fade-in stagger-4">Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="fade-in stagger-5">
