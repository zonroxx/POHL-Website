      <h2>Interpreters and Translators</h2>
      <div class="info-box">

      <p>
        POHL is the only organization located in the CNMI that employs a staff of certified, professional interpreters and translators who are conversant in not only several of the Micronesian languages such as Chamorro, Carolinian and Palauan but also several foreign languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        These interpreters possess the highest degree of integrity and ability to work independently without supervision while addressing the unique, often highly complex circumstances with which the firm's clients seek assistance. As the point of initial contact for non-English speaking clients, an interpreter must be educated and experienced enough to make the appropriate inquiries to discern which of many applicable laws may be implicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many cases, a client may present facts involving potential violations of several different laws or regulations for which relief is available. The interpreter works closely with both the attorneys and clients to make sure that the client understands a legal system that is often very different from that of their home country. The interpreter serves as a bridge between the two systems while also analyzing the various options that may be available to resolve the legal issue presented by the client's circumstances.
      </p>

      <h2>The Product</h2>
      <p>
        POHL provides victims of crime, especially domestic violence, sexual assault and trafficking in persons, legal services delivered by highly experienced, professional staff. From the attorneys to the interpreters and management team, POHL strives to provide extensive, continual training for each of the members of the staff from the accountant to the attorneys and interpreter/translators. With the assistance of many collaborative partners, POHL can accomplish what many other non-profit organizations cannot through our training programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to begin our activities in the Marianas Archipelago (Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) and to then as resources become available expand to the other American insular territories and the Freely Associated States and Nations within Micronesia and on to include Melanesia and Polynesia.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to providing legal services and counseling, it is POHL's intent to assist these insular communities in standing up operations similar to that of the Federal Labor Ombudsman. Prior to its closure on October 1, 2012, the success of the Federal Labor Ombudsman in the Marianas at identifying victims of human trafficking and other serious abuses was based on its ability to provide a confidential environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Victims knew that they could find not only humanitarian assistance but also hands-on guidance through the complex legal infrastructure normally involved in each of their respective cases. This is one of the reasons that the State Department, Office for Combatting and Monitoring Trafficking, in its 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report, urged the establishment of Ombudsman operations in the insular areas and then eventually to known major hubs of trafficking activities in the U.S. mainland.
